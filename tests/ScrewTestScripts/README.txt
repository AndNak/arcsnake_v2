Screw Tests Procedures and Instructions

Things to keep in mind while setting up:
- Plug sensor into computer at least 30 min. before testing to let it warm up
- Have the sensor display open and reading during set upso you can make sure you don't overload sensor accidentally
- Keep a written log of the tests you are performing. Organize by set # and test #
  make sure to write down the conditions for each set and test (media used, input params)

Single Screw Tests
Constant Speed Test:
1) Configuration should be in free hang. Ensure that media is smoothed and uniform as possible
2) Write down current set/test info in notebook. 
3) Ensure proper set/test number is set on motor script AND sensor log
4) Start motor script and sensor log (I try to start them at the same time but it doesn't have to be exact)
5) synchronization procedure will start: screw spins two times.
6) After synchronization procedure, you have 15 seconds to set the screw down. Gently push it into media to sink it in.
7) 15 seconds after sync procedure, actual trial will start. Be prepared to stop motor script just in case.
8) Ensure that the proper data files (with the correct set/test number) were saved.
